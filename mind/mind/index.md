# Mind and its relation to nature

In Meditation II, after realizing that he can know with certainty that he exists, Descartes next asked himself what exactly is the nature of this thing I. His initial answer was that there are two distinct things that make up his nature: a mind and a body. Somehow, these two things are united in the person that is Descartes (or any of us, for that matter).

One of the primary issues of interest the philosophy of mind is the task of spelling out the nature of the relation that unites the mind and the body together. In this class we will look at three different types of theory regarding the nature of the mind.

+ **Dualism:** This type of theory maintains that mental stuff and physical stuff are two distinct kinds of stuff. They are united in a person by way of a two-way interactionism. That is, some mental events bring about some physical events, and some physical events bring about some mental events.
+ **Idealism:** This type of theory maintains that it is a mistake to think of physical stuff as a unique kind. Instead, we explain everything that is apparently physical in terms of mental stuff. So, the mind and body are united because mind is all that there is.
+ **Physicalism:** This type of theory maintains that it is a mistake to think of mental stuff as a unique kind. Instead, we explain everything that is apparently mental in terms of physical stuff. So, the mind and physical body are united because the physical body is all there is.

Before we jump into the arguments for and against these different theories, let’s get more clear on the primary players in the discussion: mind and body.

## Mind 

When we talk about the mind, we mean any collection of mental states and events. These sorts of things include:

+ Sensory experiences: the color green, the feel of pain, the sound of a pin dropping, the smell of a rose, the taste of brussels sprouts.
+ Cognitive states: the belief that 2+2=4, the desire to ride a unicorn, the memory of hitting a home run.
+ Emotions: love, anger, fear.
+ Feelings: hunger, itchiness, excitement, drunkenness.

### Qualia 

Many of the items in the list above are strongly associated with certain physical objects (my itch is located on my arm). But what we are concerned with is the qualitative feel (sometimes called qualia) of these various states. As an exercise, next time you are in one of the states above, reflect on it. Try to separate the mental quality from its physical source, and just reflect on the feeling, sensation,
image, or idea of which you are consciously aware. That is the mental thing we’re interested in understanding.

## Body

When we talk about the body, we’re talking about extended physical things and physical events. These sorts of things include:

+ Objects: galaxies, solar systems, planets, chairs, trees, humans, fish, amoebae, molecules, electrons, quarks, electromagnetic
waves.
+ Forces: gravity, electromagnetism, weak and strong nuclear. 2
+ Events: the raising of my arm, the construction of a bridge, an electrical discharge, the digestion of food, the blooming of a flower.

On the face of it, it seems totally obvious that these two kinds of things exist. Now let’s examine some theories and see how well they account for these various items.

# Dualism

Dualism is the thesis that the mind and the body are distinct entities. It may be that mental and physical events are perfectly correlated, such that whenever I decide to raise my hand (mental event) it raises (physical event) and whenever I stub my toe (physical event) I feel a distinctive pain (mental event). But the dualist maintains that in all instances such as this, we must recognize two different events, one
mental and one physical.

## The disembodiment argument

The main argument for dualism stems from Descartes’ discussion in the Meditations, and is known as the disembodiment argument. The basis of the argument is a thought experiment. In order to appreciate the force of the argument, we are asked to bring about some experience (perhaps that of a slight pain we induce by pinching ourselves. Then, we are asked to reflect on the experience itself, doing our best to push aside our ideas about its cause or its physical instantiation; we will use the experience of a slight pain. The argument then proceeds as follows:
  
1. I can conceive of myself possessing mental features while possessing no physical features whatsoever–while being disembodied.
2. If I can conceive of a particular scenario occurring, then that scenario is possible.
3. So, it is possible that I possess mental features without any physical ones.
4. If a thing is identical to another thing, then they cannot possibly occur separately.
5. So, mental things are not identical to any physical state.

This is a valid argument. Premise 3 follows from 1 and 2. Premise 4 is a thesis about the nature of identity and seems unassailable. Proposition 5 follow from 3 and 4. So the only two points of attack are premises 1 and 2. Let’s look at these in turn.

### Conceiving of disembodiment

Premise 1 makes a claim about what our minds are capable of. It suggests that there is nothing contradictory about imagining experiences that occur in the absence of a body that hosts them. Now, many people find this claim to be perfectly obvious; Descartes, for instance, built his entire system of belief off of this fact. 

But this doesn’t mean that it is an easy scenario to imagine. Our thoughts are deeply entrenched in our representation of our bodies. So, focusing on bare experiences without letting ideas of their causal source creep in requires a fair amount of mental exertion. If, after sufficient effort, you are unable of imagining the scenario that is introduced in premise 1, then the argument will not be forceful for you. Of course, simply pointing out that you can’t conceive of the scenario won’t matter much to someone who claims they can. So, to challenge the argument, we need to look for other, more objective issues with it.

### Conceivability and possibility

Premise 2 makes a claim about the relationship between what scenarios we can imagine and what scenarios are possible. It maintains that if we can conceive of it, then it is possible. But one might ask why this should be the case. Why should the things we are capable of thinking up link up with the things that are genuinely possible?

Imagining possibilities requires conceptualization. Notice first that all reasoning utilizes concepts. There’s no way for us to "get outside" of our concepts and examine their adequacy; to do that, we would have to use other concepts. So, our only real guide to what is possible is our ability to conceive of scenarios. And if a scenario is conceptually coherent, then we have no good reason to deny its
possibility.

But perhaps there are certain concepts that don’t link up to possibility; maybe because our use of them is defective in some way. This can happen when we don’t have a very good grasp of the concept we try to employ. For instance, a beginning geometry student may possess the concepts of right triangle, legs, and hypoteneuse, and imagine a scenario in which some right triangle is such that the sum of the squares of its legs is unequal to the square of its hypoteneuse. Yet, this scenario is impossible. The problem is that the student is conceiving without having a sufficient grasp of the concepts he utilizes.

Thus, we learn that we must be careful in how we apply these thought experiments. But, it would seem on its face that we have a fairly good grasp of concepts such as pain and other mental experiences. After all, we are as intimately connected to these phenomena as anything else we can try to think about.

Yet, even quite familiar concepts can lead us into trouble regarding possibility. Take the concept of water, for example. Water, as we know, is just a chemical compound composed of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom; that is water is identical to H<sub>2</sub>O. This means that water and H<sub>2</sub>O can never occur separately. 

But we might think we can conceive of a scenario on some distant planet where the stuff
that fills the lakes ans streams, that people drink, and so on is not H<sub>2</sub>O, but some other chemical instead. We might then claim that we are conceiving of water in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O. Since this is impossible, conceivability does not entail possibility.

If these suggestions about the concept of water go through, then premise 2 is false, and the argument fails. But we can save the premise as it applies to concepts such as pain if we can show that pain is different from water in a significant way. Indeed, this does seem to be the case. When we reflect on the concept water, we think of it as having a hidden essence; that is, we think of it as picking out whatever stuff it is that makes it up. Thus, the essence of water is something that we can only discover via scientific investigation. It is possible for us to mistakenly apply the concept of water (to think we’re in the presence of water when we aren’t).

But pain seems to be different. There isn’t anything to pain that is hidden from us. When we’re in pain, we know it. Pain wears its essence on its sleeve, so to speak. Thus, it would seem that we won’t be mistaken about what is possible regarding the occurrence of pain. If so, then just because conceivability fails to be a good guide to possibility for concepts such as water, this doesn’t undermine the argument as it is employed here regarding transparent concepts such as pain.

## The interaction problem

According to the dualist, minds and bodies are distinct things. In fact, as Descartes describes them, they have nothing in common. Remember that Descartes takes the essence of mind to be thought and the essence of body to be extension; Thought has no location
in space, and extension has no intentionality. But this view of the nature of these two fundamental substances leads to an interesting puzzle. How do we explain the fact that mind and body interact with eachother?

It seems obvious that there is a two-way interaction between the mind and the body:

+ Mental events (such as decisions) can cause physical events (such as arm raisings).
+ Physical events (such as toe stubbings) can cause mental events (such as pains).

But it’s very strange indeed to talk of causal relations between things that share no properties in common. Think about the human eye. It is designed to pick up on electro-magnetic waves within a very specific range of wavelengths. Thus, no matter how much microwave energy passes near my head, it’s not gonna have any (visual) impact on me because my eyes just aren’t equipped to pick it up.

The same goes for mind and body on the dualist picture. Thought just doesn’t seem to be the kind of thing that can push matter around, since it doesn’t have any surface that can interact with physical bodies. It doesn’t even have a physical location!

We might try to think of the mind as a special non-physical force. Gravity obviously acts on bodies without them bumping into each other. Perhaps the mind works in the same way. But really, the way gravity works isn’t obvious at all. It really troubled Newton that his theory involved mysterious action at a distance. And one of the main features of Einstein’s general relativity theory is that it does away with this idea. In relativity theory, all objects are connected in space-time, and gravity is just curvature in the speace-time fabric.

# Physicalism

The physicalist proposes to answer the interaction problem by denying that mind and body are so different after all. The physicalist maintains that every purported mental event that we come across is nothing other than some physical event in disguise. If mental events just are physical events, then they have extension, and there’s no longer any worry about how they work into the causal order; they can push things around just like pool cues and bulldozers do.

Thus, the primary task for the physicalist is to located the mind in the physical realm, to say just what physical things the mental things are. Perhaps the best place to start is with what seems to be the locus of mental activity the brain.

## Mind-brain identity

One physicalist theory is that the mind is identical to the brain. In particular, every kind of mental event can be fully understood as the occurrence of some sort of event in the brain. In order to make good on this claim the identity theorist would have to come up with a corresponding mental occurrence for every type of mental state. 

Obviously we aren’t at a stage of brain-science where we can do this, so to investigate the theory, the identity theorist will usually provide stand-in definitions like the following:

+ pain = c-fiber firing
+ believing that one is seeing a green patch = locus G of b-fibers firing

What exactly "c-fibers" are is something that we will discover with further research on the brain.

## Multiple realizability

Perhaps the identity theorist can make sense of all the usual features of the mind that people tend to think sets it apart from the brain. But there is one objection to the identity theory that many people take to be devastating. That is the objection that the identity theory is overly chauvinistic. It is also known as the multiple realizability argument. To see the force of the argument, consider the following
hypothetical scenario.

> Human kind makes content with an alien life form. They come to our planet in droves, and begin setting up colonies. There are struggles at first. Battles break out, and some of the visitors are shot. Those that are shot cry out and squirm, and they fire back with devices that send off strange electrical blasts. The early times are trying, but eventually peace is established. We begin to learn eachothers’ respective languages, and they tell us what interests them, the foods they like, their desires, and their theories of physics. It would seem obvious to anyone who listens that they live as rich of mental lives as we do. But we also come to learn of their physiology. We learn that they aren’t carbon based at all; in fact, they aren’t even silicon based. Instead their bodies are actuated by a complex array of fiber optic cables. They think by means of light. 

I contend that this story is perfectly imaginable. Even if we never encounter alien life with just these properties, the possibility of mental entities with different physical makeup from us is enough to undermine the identity theory. This is because according to the identity theory, pain is identical to c-fiber firing. But the aliens don’t have c-fibers at all, which means they also don’t have pain.

This is an unacceptable result. The identity theory is chauvinistic because it rules out by definition the possibility of mental systems different from our own. But the thought experiment above shows that it is possible for the same mental properties (such as pain) to be realized in different kinds of physical systems. Thus, we say that mental properties are multiply realizable. Because the identity theory doesn’t allow for this, it is false.

## Functionalism

But the fact of multiple realizability doesn’t mean we must give up on physicalism entirely. Identity of parts is just one relation that might hold between the mind and the body. We need to find a different way of explaining the existence of mental events in purely physical terms.

What the multiple realizability examples seem to show is that the stuff we are made of isn’t so important to our mentality. What makes us along with the aliens mental beings is that the various bits of stuff we are made of play specific roles in our organized system.

Functionalism is the thesis that mental events are identified with the functions that different physical entities perform in the system as a whole. Thus, the reason that both humans and the aliens in our example experience pain that that we both have specific physical systems that perform the role of pain in our bodies.

To better understand the idea behind functionalism, take the example of a car. There are electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell cars, and gas powered cars. Each of these has an engine, but their engines are vastly different in terms of their composition and structure. What makes them all engines is the role they play in the car. Their function is to take in energy and convert it into motion.

Functionalism proposes we understand mental entities, like experiences of pain, in the same way. Humans, aliens, and other animals experience pain because they each have a structural unit of their system that serves the same role. In the case of pain that role (function) is to take in tissue damage and output wincing, cursing, avoidance, and retaliation. Thus, functionalism provides definitions of mental events such as the following:

+ pain = tissue damage recognition and avoidance
+ belief = the function of taking in desires and acting in accordance with them

This still counts as a physicalist theory because each being with mental states is composed entirely of physical parts. But the mental states aren’t identical to those parts. The physical parts are simply the things that realize the particular mental function. The qualia problem for functionalism Like other physicalist theories of mind, functionalism has trouble making sense of the qualitative fell associated with mental experience.

A good example of the problem is the inverted spectrum. It seems possible that when I look at a red object I have a very different inner experience than you do when you look at the same object. Perhaps the quality of my experience of red is more like the quality of your experience of green. If it was possible for me to "see through your eyes" colors would strike me a inverted. Most of us probably think that this idea is possible in principle even if it doesn’t actually occur. But if functionalism is the true theory of the mind, then this sort of situation is ruled out by definition.

Even if our experiences of colors are very different, we nevertheless act the same when we experience colors. We call the same things "red", we both stop at stop signs, etc. But this is just to say that our systems for recognizing colors perform the same functions. They always result in the same outputs given certain inputs. According to functionalism, that makes my experience of red identical with yours. Thus, the case we’ve described is incompatible with functionalism. Since the case is a genuine possibility, that is a problem for the theory of functionalism.

Of course, explaining the qualitative feel of mental experience is a challenge for any physicalist theory. We won’t go into detail on various ways of trying to explain qualia in this class. Most contemporary philosophers who have physicalist leanings take the multiple realizability arguments to speak strongly in favor of functionalism as the correct theory of the mind.

**Functionalism and artificial intelligence:** Notice that, according to functionalism, any system that realizes the appropraite set of roles (pain, belief, desire, hope) is an entity with a mental life. In particular, even a system that is created by another mental creature can be a mental entity. Thus, the theory of functionalism provides the groundwork for reasearch into artificial intelligence.

# Artificial intelligence

The primary question that we want to answer in relation to artificial intelligence is "Can machines think?" Unless the answer to this question is positive, there’s no sense in talking about artificial intelligence in the first place. Alan Turing proposed that the answer to this question is indeed positive, but he suggests that the framing of the question in this way is too ambiguous to answer clearly. So he proposed that we ask a slightly different question, and if we answer that one positively, then that will suffice for answering whether machines can think.

Turing’s suggestion is that the more pertinent question is : “Can a machine do well on the imitation game?”

## The imitation game

The essentials of Turing’s game are as follows:

+ There are three players A, B, and C.
+ A and B are located in different rooms, and C doesn’t know which is in which room.
+ C labels the unknown players X and Y.
+ C can pose questions to both X and Y and receive their answers.
+ A and B need not be honest in the responses they give.
+ The responses should be presented to C in such a way that their form doesn’t give away the identity of the responder. Preferably,
the responses would be typed.
+ C’s objective is to use his questions to determine which of X or Y is A.
+ A wins if C misidentifies him.

## The suggestion

Now, let A be a machine, and B and C be humans. Turing’s suggestion is the following:

1. If A wins the game (in a high proportion of trials), then machines can think.
2. At some point in the future, a machine will do well in the imitation game.
3. Therefore, machines can think.

## Ways of objecting 

Turing’s argument is valid, so if someone is to object to his conclusion, they need to deny one of his premises 1 or 2. 

Thus, there are two general ways to go.

+ One could deny premise 1 and claim that doing well in this game is not sufficient for being able to think. This objection maintains that thinking involves something further that the game doesn’t necessarily reveal.
+ One could deny premise 2 and claim that no machine will ever do well in the imitation game.

### Objections to the test

In this section, we will briefly look at some of the objections to Turing’s premise 1. These objections suggest that the test fails to get at something essential to human thought. If the test can’t distinguish between humans and machines in terms of this feature of thought, then the test doesn’t show us that the machine is thinking.

#### Consciousness 

One thing that we might think is crucial to how humans think is consciousness. In order to be a thinking thing, the entity must feel something. The imitation game doesn’t reveal whether the machine genuinely feels anything, so it is inadequate.

But notice that this objection proves too much. We face the same problem when we encounter other humans. The only evidence we have that they are thinking is the behaviors that we witness. We don’t actually see their feelings. So, unless we are willing to deny that we know that other humans think, we can’t rightfully deny that the imitation game is good enough to reveal that machines think.

#### Creativity

Most of the objections to Turing’s argument are versions of the Lady Lovelace objection. Examples of the objection include: 

+ Machines can never go beyond their programs.
+ Machines can’t exhibit creativity.

In a sense, it’s true that machines are limited to their programs. But this might not be all that much of a limitation. There is a sense in which machines can learn. It is possible for machines to have feedback loops, which are functions that operate on the machine’s own program. Thus, if we equip a machine with certain input devices (like a camera and pressure sensors) and give it mobility, it could take in various data and develop its own program in a variety of ways. When we think of it this way, this machine doesn’t seem to be all that different from the way humans develop. Humans start with an initial brain state and utilize the inputs they get from their senses to
expand on and alter this initial state.

Additionally, in order for this sort of objection to have any bite, we must be clear on what we mean by "creativity".

+ If by creative thought we just mean coming up with a surprising or interesting result, then it’s not clear that machines aren’t creative. Even very good programmers don’t know exactly what will result from the program when it runs. There are a great
number of complexities in the machine’s operation that are glossed over in the programming process.
+ If, instead, we mean something like coming up with a result that has no causal precursor, then it’s true that machines aren’t creative in this sense. But then neither are humans. Every idea we have is the result of some cause or other. We may have a difficult time saying just what brought up that thought, but surely it came from somewhere.

There may be some other way of understanding the notion of creativity that distinguishes between humans and machines. The point is that it isn’t obvious just what machines are lacking that humans possess.

**Rules for human behavior:** One might think that we can’t specify the rules that guide human behavior. But machine behavior is perfectly characterized by its program. Thus, human action comes about in a different way from machine action.

It may be true that we can’t specify the rules that govern our action. We maight not even be personally aware of why we performed a specific action. But it doesn’t follow from this that there are no laws governing human action. We don’t think that human action is random, so there must be something guiding the way we act, even if we can’t spell it out exactly.
