Please provide answers to **3** of the prompts below. Each answer is worth a possible **35 points**. Complete answers should require around 1.5 typed pages double spaced. Save your answers in a single PDF file, submit the file through Canvas, and bring a hard copy to class on Friday 11/13.

**Bonus:** If you choose, you may answer all four prompts. The fourth response is worth a potential **15 bonus points**. Please indicate which answer you wish to be counted as the bonus response.

1. David Hume thinks that we have no good justification for reasoning by induction. Explain Hume's reason for thinking this. Be sure to explain what _causal beliefs_ are and the role that the _uniformity of nature hypothesis_ plays in his argument. Karl Popper thinks that the way around Hume's problem is _falsificationism_. Explain how science works according to falsificationism and how this gets around Hume's problem of induction.

2. Dualism and physicalism are competing accounts of the relationship between the mind and the body. Each faces some serious difficulties. First, state the thesis of _dualism_ and explain the _interaction problem_ that it faces. Then state the thesis of the _identity theory_ of physicalism and explain why _multiple realizability_ is a problem for it. Finally, state the thesis of _functionalism_ and explain why the possibility of _inverted spectrums_ poses a challenge for it.

3. Alan Turing famously argued that we ought to recognize the possibility that machines can think just as we grant that ability to other humans. Explain why Turing's _imitation game_ suggests that machines can think. Then explain what you take to be the best argument against Turing's claim. Be clear on how the argument undermines Turing's position.

4. On their face, free will and determinism seem to be incompatible. Explain why this is so. But Harry Frankfurt thinks that they can be reconciled. Explain how Frankfurt makes sense of free will within a deterministic world view. Be sure to explain the role that _responsibility_ plays in his account.
