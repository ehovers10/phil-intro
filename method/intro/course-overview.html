<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
This is an introductory course in philosophy, the primary goals of which are:
       <ul class="itemize1">
       <li class="itemize">to provide a broad base of familiarity with areas of concern in academic philosophy; this includes classic philosophical
       theories and arguments, as well as the original texts in which they are found. Upon completion of the course, students
       will be able to engage knowledgeably in debates pertaining to a wide variety of philosophical subdisciplines.
       </li>
       <li class="itemize">to develop skills in philosophical argumentation and discussion. Throughout the course, students will critically examine
       controversial issues, learn how to construct and evaluate logical arguments, and gain experience in presenting their own
       ideas in rational and thoughtful ways.
       </li>
       <li class="itemize">to  connect  philosophical  theories  to  real-world  issues.  By  actively  engaging  in  the  course,  students  will  come  to
       understand how the ideas we discuss in class matter for their interaction with the world they inhabit.
       </li></ul>

<p>The course content is divided into 5 modules, each of which reflects an important sub-discipline of philosophy. The modules are:
Philosophical method, Epistemology, Mind and metaphysics, Ethics, and Political philosophy.</p>

<p>We will spend roughly equal time on each of these modules, and part of each module will be dedicated to explaining exactly what each
subdivision of philosophy amounts to. See the course schedule on Canvas for details.</p>
