<p>This class will have two midterm exams and one exam during the finals period. The exams are equally weighted, and each exam will cover approximately one third of the course material. That is to say, the exams will not be cummulative; though, certain concepts covered early in the class will be relevant to later material as well.</p>
<p>The purpose of the exams is for the student to demonstrate an understanding of the philosophical concepts, methods, and arguments introduced in course lectures.</p>

<h3 id="exams-format">Format</h3>

<p>Each exam is worth 100 points and has two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Short answer questions (40 points)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The short answer questions will test your ability to recall the philosophical concepts introduced in class.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be some fill in the blank questions as well as questions that ask you to state particular principles of premises of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete responses to these questions should require no more than one paragraph.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Extended response questions (60 points)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The extended answer questions will test your comprehension of the philosophical discussions covered in class.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be expected to explain clearly and succinctly certain philosophical arguments, positions, and principles.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be given a choice of multiple prompts (between 3 and 6) from which you will choose a selection to answer (between 2 and 4).</p></li>
<li><p>It is difficult to give a definitive length for these responses. The most accurate advice I can give is that you should answer the question completely. A more informative answer is that the response should be at least a paragraph, and likely two or three in most cases.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>The grade for each of your answers will be determined by the <strong>accuracy</strong>, <strong>completeness</strong>, and <strong>clarity</strong> of your responses, with these components roughly equally weighted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A response that fails to address material relevant to the question will be docked for its incompleteness.</p></li>
<li><p>A response that misconstrues the material or includes excessive material not relevant to the question will be docked for its inaccuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>A response that is hard to reas or to follow, or a response that appears to be a mere regurgitation of various keywords from the notes will be docked for its unclarity.</p></li>
</ul>
