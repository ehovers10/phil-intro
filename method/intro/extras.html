<p>Active participation in class discussion is in the best interests of all students. It is the best way to develop an understanding of the
course material, and it helps to clear up confusions. Often a question you have is shared by others; by engaging with each other, we
mutually improve our understanding.</p>

<p>Exams will draw heavily on material discussed in lectures, and class discussion will go beyond the lecture notes provided on Canvas.
In addition, active participation will reflect favorably on course grades in borderline cases. This doesn't mean that you must have
something to say for each class, but you should regularly try to contribute.</p>

<p>Participating helpfully requires preparation. Students are expected to read the assigned texts before the class in which they will be
addressed.</p>

<p>Frequent absence and tardiness disrupt class discussion and indicate an unwillingness on the part of the student to actively engage in
the class. Please show up to class on time. If you must miss a class, please contact me ahead of time with a valid reason for your
absence.</p>

<p>Students are expected to submit all assignments by the posted due date and time. Late assignments will be subject to a penalty of <span class="cmbx-10">one-half letter grade</span> for every day they are past due, unless arrangements are made with the instructor well before the assignment due date.</p> 

<p>Exceptions will be made for properly documented emergencies; in these rare instances, students will be given extra time to complete
the missed assignment.</p>

<p>The MSU Philosophy Department collects student evaluations of each course near the end of the semester. These evaluations are greatly useful to the instructor and the department. To ensure high participation in the evaluations, students will be
required to email the instructor with a confirmation validation received upon completing the online survey for the course.</p>

<p>The classroom environment should be a safe space for exchange of ideas. Nobody should feel unwelcome or that their thoughts are not equally respected. I promise to do what I can to maintain civility during class discussions. If you have any questions or concerns about this, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>Additional accommodations will be made for students who require them. For more information, contact the Disability Resource Center, located in Webster Hall, room 100 (<a href="http://www.montclair.edu/disability-resource-center">www.montclair.edu/disability-resource-center</a>).</p>
