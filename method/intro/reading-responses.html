<p>Critical reading of texts is an invaluable skill in philosophical investigation. The reading responses are designed to help you hone this skill. Thus, you can think of reading responses as akin to lab reports in an introductory science class.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Reading responses are short writing assignments. They should be <strong>2-3 pages</strong> (double spaced, 11-12pt font, 1in margins) and have two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em>Exegesis</em>: A summary of a portion of the reading under discussion, including argument premises, key theses, and significant implications. This part is intended for you to display your reading comprehension; the summary should be in your own words, and direct quotation should be used only sparingly.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Critique</em>: An analysis of the philosophical content of the reading under discussion. The nature of this section is fairly open ended. Some options include: a development of a critique of the author’s thesis, an alternative to the author’s proposal, an application of the author’s proposal to an aspect of daily life, a comparison of the theory to alternate theories discussed in class.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You should dedicate approximately equal space to each part.</p></li>
<li><p>The frst page of your response should include <strong>your name, the title of the article under discussion</strong>, and <strong>the assignment due date</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Reading responses should be saved in <strong>PDF format</strong> and submitted via Canvas by noon on the appropriate due date. Almost all current word processing programs allow you to export files as PDF. If you are uncertain how to do this, please take the time to learn well before the first assignment due date.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading-1">Grading</h3>

<p>Each reading response is worth <strong>40 points</strong>. The exegesis and critique are each worth 15 points, with the remaining 10 points for the overall clarity and cohesion of the response.</p>
<p>There are 6 reading response assignments throughout the semester, one for each module covered. Each response must address one of the readings from the relevant module. Your final grade will only include 5 responses, and I will throw out your lowest response grade.</p>
<p>The grading criteria for each section of the response are as follows, with the criteria roughly equally weighted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exegesis</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Accuracy</em>: The exegesis should accurately portray the author’s position.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Focus</em>: One cannot possibly summarize an entire philosophy paper in 1.5 pages. It is important to focus one’s discussion on a specific portion of the reading.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Detail</em>: In philosophical writing, the method one uses and the arguments one employs are just as important as the conclusion one goes for. It is important to present the details of the portion of the reading you focus on, and not just the author’s main conclusion.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Critique</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Originality</em>: You are not expected to revolutionize the field of philosophy, but your critique should reflect your own thinking on the issue. You can make use of class lectures and the introductions in the textbook in forming your ideas, but be sure to acknowledge any sources you use.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Relevance</em>: The critique should address the issues presented in the exegesis.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Specificity</em>: When offering a critique, it is important to be clear on just what issue one is addressing. Broad generalizations can be provacative, but it is attention to the specific issues that makes a critique compelling.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
