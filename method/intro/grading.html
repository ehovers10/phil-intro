Student grades will be determined based on performance on <span class="cmbx-10">three in class exams</span>, <span class="cmbx-10">five reading response assignments</span>, and <span class="cmbx-10">attendance and participation </span>in class discussion. The exams involve a combination of short and extended response questions. The reading responses are short writing assignments pertaining to the assigned readings. The purpose of the response papers is to develop students' critical reading skills.

Details regarding the assessment criteria, including a grading rubric, are available in a separate document on Canvas.
