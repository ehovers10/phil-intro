<p>Imagine that you are thirsty. In front of you is a glass that is full of a clear liquid. The liquid appears to be water. I know (but you don’t) that the liquid is gasoline.</p>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span>In this scenario, both <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>B</em></span> can be true</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math"><em>A</em></span>: There is reason for you to drink the liquid in the glass.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math"><em>B</em></span>: There is reason for you to not drink the liquid in the glass.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="subjective-v.-objective-1">Subjective v. objective</h3>
<p><span><span class="math"><em>A</em></span> references a <strong>subjective</strong> reason</span> Given the state of your knowledge and your desires, it makes sense for you to drink the liquid.</p>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span><span class="math"><em>B</em></span> references an <strong>objective</strong> reason</span> Given the state of the world as it actually is and your desires, it doesn’t make sense for you to drink the liquid.</p>
<p>Our goal as inquirers is to come to mutually accept <em>objective</em> reasons. But if someone’s behavior doesn’t make sense from our perspective, it can be valuable to see if we can make sense of it in terms of the <em>subjective</em> reasons they have at their disposal.</p>
