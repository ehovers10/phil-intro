\frametitle{Subjective v. objective}

Imagine that you are thirsty.  In front of you is a glass that is full of a clear liquid.  The liquid appears to be water. I know (but you don't) that the liquid is gasoline.

\begin{block}<2->{In this scenario, both $A$ and $B$ can be true}
  \begin{enumerate}[$\rightharpoonup$]
    \item $A$: There is reason for you to drink the liquid in the glass.
    \item $B$: There is reason for you to not drink the liquid in the glass.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Subjective v. objective}

\begin{block}{$A$ references a \textbf{subjective} reason}
  Given the state of your knowledge and your desires, it makes sense for you to drink the liquid.
\end{block}

\begin{block}<2->{$B$ references an \textbf{objective} reason}
  Given the state of the world as it actually is and your desires, it doesn't make sense for you to drink the liquid.
\end{block}

Our goal as inquirers is to come to mutually accept \textit{objective} reasons.  But if someone's behavior doesn't make sense from our perspective, it can be valuable to see if we can make sense of it in terms of the \textit{subjective} reasons they have at their disposal.
