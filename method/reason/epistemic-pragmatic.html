  Reasons speak in favor of some belief. But there are different ways that a belief can have something going for it.

<h4>Bear chase</h4>
  <p>You are being chased through the woods by a bear.  All of a sudden, you break into a clearing and approach the edge of a chasm.  The chasm looks to be about 20ft wide. It occurs to you that if you try to change course, you will most certainly be devoured by the bear.  But you also recall that the best long jumpers in the world rarely jump more than 25ft, and you are no world class athlete. You are in quite a predicament.</p>
</div>

<div id="notbel" class="tab-list eh-tablist-content">
<h4>You have reason to believe that you cannot make the jump.</h4>
<p>All of your evidence suggests that the distance is too far for you to cross in a single leap.</p>
</div>

<div id="bel" class="tab-list eh-tablist-content">
<h4>You have reason to believe that you can make the jump.</h4>
<p>If you don’t jump, you’re gonna get eaten. And maybe believing you can make it will give you a slightly better chance of doing so. So, you might as well believe it.</p>
</div>

<div id="ambi" class="tab-list eh-tablist-content">
<h4>Different kinds of belief</h4>
<p>On their face, these claims and are in direct contradition. The fact that they both seem true suggests that there is an <strong>ambiguity</strong> in our use of the word “reason”.</p>
<p>Let’s use the term <strong>epistemic reason</strong> to refer to the kind of reason mentioned in 1. Epistemic reasons appeal to our cognitive faculties and purport to support the <strong>truth</strong> of some claim.</p>
<p>And let’s call the kind of reason mentioned in 2, <strong>pragmatic reason</strong>. Pragmatic reasons appeal to our connative faculties (our senses of emotion and well-being) and purport to show that we <strong>benefit</strong> in some way from believing the claim.</p>
