<p>Why did Frank take the marble rye home?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Because he paid for it.</li>
    <li>Because he thought no one was looking.</li>

<h4>Imagine that 1 is true</h4>
<p>Then it provides a reason for why Frank took the marble rye, and supposing that having paid for something gives someone the right to do with it what they please, it is a reason that <strong>justifies</strong> Frank’s behavior.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Suppose that 2 is true (and 1 is false)</h4>
<p>Then, this also provides a reason for Frank’s behavior, but it doesn’t seem to justify that behavior. Instead, one might offer this reason as a way of <strong>explaining</strong> why Frank did it.</p>
