<p>Something can be a reason for some belief when viewed on its own, but when viewed in a broader context that includes other reasons, it gets outweighed or made irrelevant.</p>

<h3>The investigation</h3>
<p>Sherlock Holmes is investigating a crime scene. He has two suspects in the crime, Dirk and Sally.</p>
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The blond hair</h4>
<p>He first comes upon a blond hair. He knows that Sally has blond hair, whereas Dirk is a brunette. This leads Holmes to say:</p>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">"I now have reason to believe that Sally is the culprit."</h4>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The fingerprint</h4>
<p>As he investigates further, he finds a solid fingerprint. His friend at the police station tells him that there is no strong correlation with the fingerprint of Sally’s that they have on file. Since fingerprint evidence is more weighty than hair folicles, Holmes now says:</p>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Now the balance of reasons suggests that Sally did not do it.</h4>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The hair dye</h4>
<p>More searching uncovers a bottle of brown hair dye in the trash and a man’s footprint at the scene. Having completed a thorough search, Holme’s exclaims:</p>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Aha! It wasn’t Sally at all, but Dirk!</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The analysis</h4>
<p>In this example, Holmes' first statement seems accurate at first blush. It is a good reason to believe that Sally did it, as far as it goes. We give this kind of reason the Latin title <strong>pro tanto</strong>.</p> 
<p>But two things happen as Holmes looks into the case in more detail.</p>
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>He gets <strong>rebutting evidence</strong> against the hair blond hair</h4>
<p>The fingerprint evidence stands in direct conflict with what the hair seems to show. And the fingerprint outweighs, or <strong>rebutts</strong> the hair.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>He gets <strong>undercutting</strong> evidence against the hair</h4>
<p>When he discovers the hair dye, he realizes that a blond hair doesn’t support Sally’s guilt at all, since Dirk very well could have been blond, and then dyed his hair as a disguise. Thus, the dye <strong>undercuts</strong> the hair.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, having put all the pieces together, Holmes forms an <strong>on balance</strong> opinion that Dirk is the criminal.</p>
