"There are two ways of looking at our duty in the matter of opinion... <em>We must know the truth; and we must avoid error,</em> -- these are our fist and great commandments as would-be knowlers; but they are not two ways of stating an identical commandment, they are two separable laws... and by choosing between them we may end by coloring differently our whole intellectual life."

<h4>Live</h4>
<p>A live option is a proposition for which both its truth and its falsity are open to us. It is not settled one way or the other.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Forced</h4>
<p>A forced option is one for which we <em>must</em> make a decision as to its truth. We cannot remain agnostic.</p>
<p>"Scepticism... is not a avoidance of option; it is option of a certain particular kind of risk." (p. 83)
<p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Momentous</h4>
<p>A momentous option is one for which the decision bears greatly on our lives. Perhaps the risk is great, or the opportunity rare.</p>

"There are... cases where a fact cannot come unless a preliminary faith exists in its coming. And where faith in a fact can help create the fact, that would be an insane logic which should say that faith running ahead of scientific evidence is the 'lowest kind of immorality' into which a thinking thing can fall."
