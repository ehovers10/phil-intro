<p>Good reasons aren't always <strong>available</strong> to us, even when we are being fully rational.</p>

<p>Our goal as inquirers is to come to mutually accept <em>objective</em> reasons. But if someone’s behavior doesn’t make sense from our perspective, it can be valuable to see if we can make sense of it in terms of the <em>subjective</em> reasons they have at their disposal.</p>

<h4>Gasoline</h4>
<p>Imagine that you are thirsty. In front of you is a glass that is full of a clear liquid. The liquid appears to be water. I know (but you don’t) that the liquid is gasoline.</p>
<p><span>In this scenario, both statements below can be true</span>:</p>

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>There is reason for you to drink the liquid in the glass.</h4>
<p>This claim references a <strong>subjective</strong> reason. Given the internal, personal state of your knowledge (and your desire to quench your thirst), it makes sense for you to drink the liquid.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>There is reason for you to not drink the liquid in the glass.</h4>
<p>This references an <strong>objective</strong> reason. Given the state of the world as it actually is (and your desire to not die), it doesn’t make sense for you to drink the liquid.</p>
