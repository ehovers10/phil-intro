<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
  <p>We looked at two arguments that suggest one can have pragmatic reason to believe in the existence of God:
    <ul>
      <li>James: believing is a live, forced, and momentous choice.</li>
      <li>Pascal: believing is the better choice in terms of expected utility.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>After all...</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>Belief in God is just a matter of opinion.</li>
  <li>Everyone has a right to their own opinion.</li>
  <li>There is no point in arguing over something that is a person's right.</li>
  <li>Therefore, there is no point in offering arguments for believing in God.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Today...</h3>
<p>...we will explore whether premise 2 is true.</p>
