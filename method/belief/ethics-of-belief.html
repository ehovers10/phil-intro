<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Thought experiments</h3>
<p>Thought experiments are an important tool in philosophy. They are often used as a means to collect data for a proposed theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>A theorist presents a hypothetical situation described in terms with which we are all familiar.</li>
<li>The theorist then asks us for our <strong>intuition</strong> about the case described in different, more theoretical terms.</li>
<li>It is claimed that our intution in the case tells us something about the concept evoked by the theoretical terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can thus test theories of certain concepts against the intuitions elicited by various thought experiments.</p>

<h4>Clifford's thought experiments</h4>

<h4>The ship owner</h4>
<p>A ship owner is approached by a group of would be emigrants who would like to use his ship to move to a new land. The ship is very old, and the owner doesn't know whether it is sea-worthy. But rather than get it inspected, he quells his worries, puts his faith in Providence, and comes to believe that the ship will make the voyage. In the middle of the journey, the ship sinks and all on board drown.</p>

<h4>The island community</h4>
<p>In an isolated, island community, everyone holds non-standard religious beliefs. A group of outsiders hears a rumor that the priests on the island have been abducting children and brainwashing them to believe their weird religious views. This, supposedly, is why everyone on the island believes what they do. The outsiders believe this rumor and start a campaign to turn the public against the priests and unseat them from their position of power. Upon an inquiry, it is found that the rumors were unfounded; the priests were not doing anything illicit regarding the youth of the island.</p>

<h4>Clifford's intuition</h4>
<p>In both of the cases presented, the main character has done something wrong:
  <ul>
    <li>The ship owner is responsible for the deaths of the passengers.</li>
    <li>The outsiders are guilty of character defamation of the priests.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Clifford's conclusion</h4>
<p>What the characters have done wrong is <strong>form a belief</strong> without adequate evidence for it.</p>
<p>From these thought experiments, Clifford draws the following principle:</p>
<p><strong>It is wrong, always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.</strong></p>
