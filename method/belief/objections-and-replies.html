<p>The belief the main character forms is false. Maybe what is wrong is that they believe falsely, not that they believe without evidence.</p>

<p>Imagine that instead of the ship sinking on the voyage to the new land, it miraculously survives.</p>
<p>Do you still think that the ship owner has done something wrong?</p>
<p>If so, then the truth of the belief is not relevant.</p>

<p>The main character performs an action that results in harm to other people. Maybe what is wrong is that they perform a bad action, not that they believe without evidence.</p>

<h4>Response</h4>
<p>Clifford has a couple responses to this objection:</p>  
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>It is impossible to separate action from belief</h4>
<p>Thus, if one condemns the action, she also condemns the belief.</p>
<p>Clifford is invoking the functional account of belief. In general, one’s beliefs are the source of our actions.</p>
<p>Thus, if an action is deemed wrong, the belief it is based on can also be deemed wrong.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Beliefs have social impact.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What we believe tends to impact how we act. Since our actions impact other people, our beliefs thereby impact other people.</li>
    <li>The very expression of our beliefs relies on the linguistic community of which we are a part.</li> 
    <ul>
      <li>The ways in which we think are influenced by the social groups in which our thoughts develop.</li>
      <li>Since our beliefs play a primary role in our thought, our beliefs are influenced by our social environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>The upshot here is that belief is as much a social activity as action. This means that beliefs can be subject to moral criticism in the same way that actions are.</p>

<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>Clifford’s principle is much too strong. After all, we can never know that our beliefs are true. If we required certainty before we could believe, we would never believe anything, and we would never act.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>The principle suggests that to have a right to one’s belief, that person must have <em>sufficient</em> evidence, but sufficient evidence doesn’t mean certainty.</p> 

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A revised case</h4>
<blockquote>Before the ship owner sends the emigrants on their adventure, he gets the boat checked out by an inspector. The inspector gives it a thorough review and determines that it is sea-worthy. With this assurance in hand, the ship owner sends it off to sea. In the middle of the journey, a fluke accident causes the ship to sink and all on board drown.</blockquote>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A different intuition</h4>
<p>Clifford thinks that in this case, we wouldn’t hold the ship owner responsible.</p>
<p>The reason is that the ship owner did what he could to aquire the evidence that his boat was safe.</p>
<p>It’s true that the ship owner isn't certain that the ship is safe. But because he has done his due dilligence to justify his belief that it is safe, he is not
responsible for its sinking.</p>

<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>The beliefs in question are extremely momentous. Since there is so much at stake, it is important to seek adequate evidence. But what about ordinary everyday beliefs? Why should we worry about seeking evidence for those?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>Clifford suggests that when we regularly believe things without adequate evidence, we develop a <strong>credulous character</strong>.</p>
<p>Being overly credulous might be detrimental to one’s own wellbeing.</p>

<p>Clifford maintains that it is also socially objectionable.</p>
<ol>
<li>As a society, we rely on the <strong>testimony</strong> of others. It isn’t feasible for us to research every question we come across on our own.</li>
<li>The success of this practice requires us to be able to <strong>trust</strong> those to whom we look. We expect them to have adequate evidence for what they are telling us.</li>
<li>Overly credulous people undermine this practice of trust in testimony.</li> <li>Thus, building a credulous character has negative social implications as well as negative consequences for the individual.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all to say that the success of the <strong>communicative exchange</strong> relies on people taking their commitments to belief seriously.</p>
