<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Pragmatic religious belief</h3>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
  <p>We looked at two arguments that suggest one can have pragmatic reason to believe in the existence of God:
    <ul>
      <li>James: believing is a live, forced, and momentous choice.</li>
      <li>Pascal: believing is the better choice in terms of expected utility.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<div style="margin:3em;"></div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Why even give arguments for this?</h3>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>After all...</h4>
  <ol>
  <li>Belief in God is just a matter of opinion.</li>
  <li>Everyone has a right to their own opinion.</li>
  <li>There is no point in arguing over something that is a person's right.</li>
  <li>Therefore, there is no point in offering arguments for believing in God.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Today...</h3>
<p>...we will explore whether premise 2 is true.</p>

<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">How do you tell what someone believes?</h3>
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Ask them</h4>
<p>Generally, a good way to find out what someone believes is to ask them whether they believe a specific proposition.</p>
<p>Of course, people sometimes lie. And it may be possible for someone to be confused about their own beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Observe their behavior</h4>
<p>We can get a sense of what people believe by watching what they do.</p>
<p>For instance, if you hear my voice squeak, I cough, and then I reach for my water bottle, you will infer that I am thirsty and that I believe that there is water in my bottle.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin:3em;"></div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Theories of belief</h4>
<p>We don't see beliefs (except maybe our own) directly, but we have good reason to think that they are out there.</p>
<p>In this way, beliefs are like <em>electrons</em>. Just like there are competing theories of the electron, there are competing theories of what beliefs are.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent theories of belief is the <em>functional account of belief</em>.</p>
</div>

<div style="margin:3em;"></div>

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The functional account of belief</h4>
<p>The functional account of belief is an explanation for why it works to read one's beliefs off of their actions.</p>
<p>The account says that beliefs <em>just are</em> those things that (in conjunction with our desires) lead us to behave in specific ways under the proper conditions.</p>
<p>The proper conditions include: 
  <ul>
    <li>That we are not radically mistaken about the world</li>
    <li>That our rationality isn't compromised by severe stress, drugs, or other mind altering substances</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Another way to put the account is:
<h5 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Behavior = Belief + Desire</h5>
Which is just to say:
<h5 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Belief = Behavior - Desire</h5>
</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A consequence</h4>
<p>No one thinks that we have a right to <em>behave</em> any way we wish. There are moral/social/rational restrictions on what it is appropriate to do in different circumstances.</p>
<p>If belief and behavior are connected in the way proposed by the functional account, then it follows that we also do not have the right to <em>believe</em> any way we want.</p>

<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Thought experiments</h3>
<p>Thought experiments are an important tool in philosophy. They are often used as a means to collect data for a proposed theory.</p>
<ul>
<li>A theorist presents a hypothetical situation described in terms with which we are all familiar.</li>
<li>The theorist then asks us for our <strong>intuition</strong> about the case described in different, more theoretical terms.</li>
<li>It is claimed that our intution in the case tells us something about the concept evoked by the theoretical terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can thus test theories of certain concepts against the intuitions elicited by various thought experiments.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Clifford's thought experiments</h4>
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The ship owner</h4>
<p>A ship owner is approached by a group of would be emigrants who would like to use his ship to move to a new land. The ship is very old, and the owner doesn't know whether it is sea-worthy. But rather than get it inspected, he quells his worries, puts his faith in Providence, and comes to believe that the ship will make the voyage. In the middle of the journey, the ship sinks and all on board drown.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>The island community</h4>
<p>In an isolated, island community, everyone holds non-standard religious beliefs. A group of outsiders hears a rumor that the priests on the island have been abducting children and brainwashing them to believe their weird religious views. This, supposedly, is why everyone on the island believes what they do. The outsiders believe this rumor and start a campaign to turn the public against the priests and unseat them from their position of power. Upon an inquiry, it is found that the rumors were unfounded; the priests were not doing anything illicit regarding the youth of the island.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Clifford's intuition</h4>
<p>In both of the cases presented, the main character has done something wrong:
  <ul>
    <li>The ship owner is responsible for the deaths of the passengers.</li>
    <li>The outsiders are guilty of character defamation of the priests.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Clifford's conclusion</h4>
<p>What the characters have done wrong is <strong>form a belief</strong> without adequate evidence for it.</p>
<p>From these thought experiments, Clifford draws the following principle:</p>
<p><strong>It is wrong, always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.</strong></p>

<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>The belief the main character forms is false. Maybe what is wrong is that they believe falsely, not that they believe without evidence.</p>
</div>
</div> 

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>Imagine that instead of the ship sinking on the voyage to the new land, it miraculously survives.</p>
<p>Do you still think that the ship owner has done something wrong?</p>
<p>If so, then the truth of the belief is not relevant.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="obj2" class="ui-content">
<div class="ui-corner-all eh-corners">
<div class="ui-bar ui-bar-e">
<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>The main character performs an action that results in harm to other people. Maybe what is wrong is that they perform a bad action, not that they believe without evidence.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>Clifford has a couple responses to this objection:</p>  
<div data-role="collapsibleset">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>It is impossible to separate action from belief</h4>
<p>Thus, if one condemns the action, she also condemns the belief.</p>
<p>Clifford is invoking the functional account of belief. In general, one’s beliefs are the source of our actions.</p>
<p>Thus, if an action is deemed wrong, the belief it is based on can also be deemed wrong.</p>
    </div>
    <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Beliefs have social impact.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>What we believe tends to impact how we act. Since our actions impact other people, our beliefs thereby impact other people.</li>
    <li>The very expression of our beliefs relies on the linguistic community of which we are a part.</li> 
    <ul>
      <li>The ways in which we think are influenced by the social groups in which our thoughts develop.</li>
      <li>Since our beliefs play a primary role in our thought, our beliefs are influenced by our social environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
      <p>The upshot here is that belief is as much a social activity as action. This means that beliefs can be subject to moral criticism in the same way that actions are.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="obj3" class="ui-content">
<div class="ui-corner-all eh-corners">
<div class="ui-bar ui-bar-e">
<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>Clifford’s principle is much too strong. After all, we can never know that our beliefs are true. If we required certainty before we could believe, we would never believe anything, and we would never act.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>The principle suggests that to have a right to one’s belief, that person must have <em>sufficient</em> evidence, but sufficient evidence doesn’t mean certainty.</p> 

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
  <div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A revised case</h4>
<blockquote>Before the ship owner sends the emigrants on their adventure, he gets the boat checked out by an inspector. The inspector gives it a thorough review and determines that it is sea-worthy. With this assurance in hand, the ship owner sends it off to sea. In the middle of the journey, a fluke accident causes the ship to sink and all on board drown.</blockquote>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A different intuition</h4>
<p>Clifford thinks that in this case, we wouldn’t hold the ship owner responsible.</p>
<p>The reason is that the ship owner did what he could to aquire the evidence that his boat was safe.</p>
<p>It’s true that the ship owner isn't certain that the ship is safe. But because he has done his due dilligence to justify his belief that it is safe, he is not
responsible for its sinking.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="obj4" class="ui-content">
<div class="ui-corner-all eh-corners">
<div class="ui-bar ui-bar-e">
<h4>Objection</h4>
</div>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>The beliefs in question are extremely momentous. Since there is so much at stake, it is important to seek adequate evidence. But what about ordinary everyday beliefs? Why should we worry about seeking evidence for those?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>Clifford suggests that when we regularly believe things without adequate evidence, we develop a <strong>credulous character</strong>.</p>
<p>Being overly credulous might be detrimental to one’s own wellbeing.</p>

<p>Clifford maintains that it is also socially objectionable.</p>
<ol>
<li>As a society, we rely on the <strong>testimony</strong> of others. It isn’t feasible for us to research every question we come across on our own.</li>
<li>The success of this practice requires us to be able to <strong>trust</strong> those to whom we look. We expect them to have adequate evidence for what they are telling us.</li>
<li>Overly credulous people undermine this practice of trust in testimony.</li> <li>Thus, building a credulous character has negative social implications as well as negative consequences for the individual.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is all to say that the success of the <strong>communicative exchange</strong> relies on people taking their commitments to belief seriously.</p>
