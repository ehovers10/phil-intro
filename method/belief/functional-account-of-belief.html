<h4>Ask them</h4>
<p>Generally, a good way to find out what someone believes is to ask them whether they believe a specific proposition.</p>
<p>Of course, people sometimes lie. And it may be possible for someone to be confused about their own beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Observe their behavior</h4>
<p>We can get a sense of what people believe by watching what they do.</p>
<p>For instance, if you hear my voice squeak, I cough, and then I reach for my water bottle, you will infer that I am thirsty and that I believe that there is water in my bottle.</p>

<h4>Theories of belief</h4>
<p>We don't see beliefs (except maybe our own) directly, but we have good reason to think that they are out there.</p>
<p>In this way, beliefs are like <em>electrons</em>. Just like there are competing theories of the electron, there are competing theories of what beliefs are.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent theories of belief is the <em>functional account of belief</em>.</p>

<h4>The functional account of belief</h4>
<p>The functional account of belief is an explanation for why it works to read one's beliefs off of their actions.</p>
<p>The account says that beliefs <em>just are</em> those things that (in conjunction with our desires) lead us to behave in specific ways under the proper conditions.</p>
<p>The proper conditions include: 
  <ul>
    <li>That we are not radically mistaken about the world</li>
    <li>That our rationality isn't compromised by severe stress, drugs, or other mind altering substances</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Another way to put the account is:
<h5 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Behavior = Belief + Desire</h5>
Which is just to say:
<h5 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Belief = Behavior - Desire</h5>
</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A consequence</h4>
<p>No one thinks that we have a right to <em>behave</em> any way we wish. There are moral/social/rational restrictions on what it is appropriate to do in different circumstances.</p>
<p>If belief and behavior are connected in the way proposed by the functional account, then it follows that we also do not have the right to <em>believe</em> any way we want.</p>
