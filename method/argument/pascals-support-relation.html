<ul>
<li><p>An individual is faced with a choice between <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> and <em>B</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual tallies up the pros and cons of both <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual adjusts the lists above to factor in the <em>significance</em> of the pros and cons for <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual compares the weighted lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Whichever choice comes out ahead is the one the individual decides to carry out.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Cost/benefit analysis is a basic form of human reasoning. It is something that we perform all the time. Let’s call the pros and cons of various choices <strong>outcomes</strong> of that choice.</p>

<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Measuring significance</h3>
<p>It isn’t very valuable to just list out the pros and cons and add up the number of each, because not all outcomes are of the same value.</p>
<p>There are two ways that significance can factor in:</p>

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h5>Some outcomes are <strong>better</strong> or <strong>worse</strong> than others.</h5>
<p>If I’m looking at two different jobs and both offer 2 perks:
<ul>
  <li>Job A offers free coffee and a parking spot.</li>
  <li>Job B offers dental coverage and paid vacation time</li>
</ul>
I’m obviously going to choose job B. I weight it's perks more highly.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h5>Some outcomes are <strong>more likely</strong> than others.</h5>
<p>When we’re deciding what to do, we don’t always know what will result from certain choices because we don’t know exactly how the world is laid out.</p>
<p>So we want to consider all sorts of possible outcomes.</p>
<p>But we can make educated guesses about how likely certain outcomes are, and the more likely ones should count for more in our decision making.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What we need is a way of making these ideas about the significance of outcomes more precise, so that we can better determine what the right choice is.</p> <p><strong>Decision theory</strong> is an attempt to do just this.</p>
