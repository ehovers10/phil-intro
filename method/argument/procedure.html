<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Working through an argument</h3>

<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
<p>Authors don't always lay their argument out in a neat fashion for you. You may have to do some work in bringing the argument out.</p>
<p>First, try to determine the author's primary conclusion.</p>
<p>Then look for major premises that the author explicitly mentions in favor of the conclusion.</p>
<p>But don't assume that the author will explicitly say everything that is important to the argument. They may leave some premises <strong>implicit</strong>. It is important to look for these and add them to your argument structure.</p>
<p>Once you have all the premises in place, make sure you understand the reasoning involved in getting from the premises to the conclusion.</p>
<p>Then, you can start to evaluate the argument. 
<ul>
  <li>Critique the reasoning: validity/strength</li>
  <li>Refute a premise: soundness/cogency</li>
</ul>
</p>
