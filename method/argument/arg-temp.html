<h3 id="example-argument">Example argument</h3>
<p><span>Example</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Premise 1: John can only be in one of three places: his office, the common room, or his classroom.</p></li>
<li><p>Premise 2: He’s not in his office.</p></li>
<li><p>Premise 3: He’s not in the common room.</p></li>
<li><p>Conclusion: So, John is in his classroom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span>The inference in this argument is a <strong>process of elimination</strong>.</span></p>
<h2 id="types-of-arguments">Types of arguments</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-argument">Types of argument</h3>
<p>We can distinguish different kinds of argument based on the nature of the support the premises are said to provide for the conclusion.</p>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span>Deductive</span> In a deductive argument, the premises provide <strong>conclusive</strong> support for the conclusion. If the premises are actually true, then <strong>there’s no way</strong> the conclusion can be false.</p>
<p>&lt;3-&gt;<span>Inductive</span> In an inductive argument, the premises make it <strong>more likely</strong> that the conclusion is true. But they don’t guarantee that the conclusion is true.</p>
<p>&lt;4-&gt;<span>Abductive</span> In an abductive argument, the premises provide a <strong>good explanation</strong> of why the conclusion is true. But even a good explanation can sometimes be incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span>Deductive</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>John is taller than Bill.</p></li>
<li><p>Bill is taller than George.</p></li>
<li><p>So, John is taller than George.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;3-&gt;<span>Inductive</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Most people who enjoy tofu are vegetarians.</p></li>
<li><p>Frank enjoys tofu.</p></li>
<li><p>So, Frank is probably a vegetarian.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;4-&gt;<span>Abductive</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Every time there is a lunar eclipse, the Earth’s shadow appears round.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Earth is a sphere, it would make sense that it’s shadow is always round.</p></li>
<li><p>So, the Earth must be a sphere.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="uses-for-the-argument-types">Uses for the argument types</h3>
<p><span>Deductive</span> Deductive arguments are useful in mathematics, and perhaps in legal settings where the standards of argumentation are incredibly high.</p>
<p><span>Inductive</span> Inductive arguments are useful in the sciences, and in applications like weather forcasting, where we want to know the chances of an outcome even if we can’t be certain that it will happen.</p>
<p><span>Abductive</span> Abductive arguments are useful in the sciences, and in group brainstorming sessions, where we may not even know what all the alternatives are, and we want to get the options out on the table.</p>
<h3 id="the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">The good, the bad, and the ugly</h3>
<p><span>Today, we looked at a <strong>taxonomy</strong> (categorization) of reasons and arguments.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>But we shouldn’t think of one kind of argument as <em>better</em> than another.</p></li>
<li><p>Different argumentation techniques are appropriate for different situations.</p></li>
<li><p>What is important is that we try to be clear on what sort of reason we are faced with, so that we can better understand how to revise our beliefs in response to it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;2-&gt;<span>But not all arguments are created equal</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Over the course of the semester, we will examine ways of assessing arguments to determine whether we should be swayed by them.</p></li>
<li><p>But we can only do this if we take the time to lay out the argument faithfully and understand what kind of reason our fellow inquirer has presented us with.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-meeting">Next meeting</h3>
<p>Next meeting we’re going to look more closely at argument structure. We’ll examine:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Types of propositions</p></li>
<li><p>Properties of arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Basic assessment criteria for arguments</p></li>
</ul>
