<p>"Either God is, or he is not. But which side shall we incline towards? Reason cannot settle anything here. There is an infinite chaos that separates us. A game is being played at the far end of this infinite distance: the coin will come down heads or tails. How will you bet? Reason will not enable you to decide either way, or rule out either alternative." (p. 60)</p>

Since a choice must necessarily be made, your reason is no more offended by choosing one rather than the other. But your happiness? Let us weigh up the gain and the loss in choosing heads. that God exists... If you win, you win everything, and if you lose, you lose nothing. So bet that he exists, without hesitation." (p. 60)</p>
