\begin{block}{Strength (measures the \textit{support} relation)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Inductive arguments purport to give reason to believe that the conclusion is probable.
  \item The better the argument is, the more probable the conclusion becomes.
  \item We say that an inductive argument is \textit{strong} just in case \textbf{if the premises are all true, then the conclusion is very likely to be true.}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}<2->{Cogency (measures the \textit{truth} of the premises)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item But not all strong arguments have true premises.
  \item If a strong argument also has true premises, we say that it is \textbf{cogent}.
  \item If we have a cogent argument, we know that the conclusion very probably true.
\end{itemize}
