<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Kinds of arguments</h3>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
We can distinguish arguments based on the nature of the support the premises are meant to provide for the conclusion
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Deductive</h4>
<p>In a deductive argument, the premises provide <strong>conclusive</strong> support for the conclusion.  If the premises are actually true, then <strong>there's no way</strong> the conclusion can be false.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>John is taller than Bill.</p></li>
<li><p>Bill is taller than George.</p></li>
<li><p>So, John is taller than George.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Inductive</h4>
<p>In an inductive argument, the premises make it <strong>more likely</strong> that the conclusion is true.  But they don't guarantee that the conclusion is true.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Most people who enjoy tofu are vegetarians.</p></li>
<li><p>Frank enjoys tofu.</p></li>
<li><p>So, Frank is probably a vegetarian.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Abductive</h4>
<p>In an abductive argument, the premises provide a <strong>good explanation</strong> of why the conclusion is true. But even a good explanation can sometimes be incorrect.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Every time there is a lunar eclipse, the Earth’s shadow appears round.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Earth is a sphere, it would make sense that it’s shadow is always round.</p></li>
<li><p>So, the Earth must be a sphere.</p></li>
</ol>
