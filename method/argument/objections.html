<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Objections</h3>

<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all">
<p>While the argument is pretty straightforward, there are some complications. Let’s look at some objections to the argument that are usually raised. The first three are common, but Pascal can offer an answer to them. The last two are a bit more serious.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>It’s not enough for someone just to believe in God for them to get into Heaven</h4> 
<p>This may be true, but it doesn’t really impact Pascal’s argument. After all, it’s still necessary for someone to get into Heaven that they believe in God. So, you still have reason to believe, even if you must do other stuff as well.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>One can’t just choose to believe something.</h4> 
<p>This is also true, but if you recognize that you have pragmatic reason to believe, you can do certain things to help you develop the belief in God. For instance, you can go to church and surround yourself with other believers. If you work at it, you will likely engender a belief in God.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Don’t we also have the choice of withholding belief entirely?</h4>
<p>It is true that for many claims it is a genuine third option to withhold belief. For instance, I neither believe nor disbelieve that there are an even number of particles in the universe.</p>
<p>But in the case of belief in God, withholding belief is equivalent to disbelief. At least according to the model Pascal is working with, agnostics suffer the same fate as atheists.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>We can’t know God's will.</h4>
<p>Pascal already admitted that epistemic reason can't tell us much of anything about God. Maybe God punishes those who believe based on pragmatic arguments. That is, he only accepts those who come to believe in him for the right reasons. If so, then the values we placed in the decision matrix might not be justified.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>What about other gods?</h4>
<p>This possibility of other gods is not in and of itself problematic for Pascal’s argument because the existence of different religions doesn’t change the values we put in the boxes of our decision matrix.</p>
<p>But it does suggest that our matrix might be incomplete.</p>
<p>Imagine the possibility “Anti-God” exists. Anti-God punishes anyone who believes in God by sending them to Hell and accepts anyone who doesn’t believe in God into Heaven. If we consider this possibility, our decision matix should look like:</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Expanded matrix</h4>
<table data-role="table" data-mode="" data-inset="true" id="decision-matrix" class="table-stripe ui-content ui-content-theme-f ui-corner-all">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center">God exists</th>
<th align="center">no God exists</th>
<th align="center">Anti-God exists</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">Believe in God</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math"> + ∞</span></td>
<td align="center"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">finite</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math"> − ∞</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">Don’t believe in God</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math"> − ∞</span></td>
<td align="center"><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">finite</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math"> + ∞</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>And our new expected values look like:

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Believe</h4>
<p class="eh-bigger"><span class="math"><em>E</em><em>U</em>(<em>Believe</em>) = <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>Believe,God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>God</em>) + <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>Believe,no-God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>no-God</em>) + <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>Believe,anti-God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>anti-God</em>)</span><br>
 = + ∞ × 0.33 + finite × 0.33 - ∞ × 0.33 <br>
 = finite <br>
</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Don't believe</h4>
<p class="eh-bigger"><span class="math"><em>E</em><em>U</em>(<em>not-Believe</em>) = <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>not-Believe,God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>God</em>) + <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>not-Believe,no-God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>no-God</em>) + <em>V</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>(<em>not-Believe,anti-God</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>anti-God</em>)</span><br>
 = - ∞ × 0.33 + finite × 0.33 + ∞ × 0.33<br>
 = finite <br>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>So now it appears that both options are equally beneficial. The upshot is that so long as the existence of Anti-God is a genuine possibility, we don’t really have a pragmatic reason for believing in God.</p>

<blockquote>"You would be foolish, since you are forced to play, not to risk your life to gain three lives in a game where there is equal chance of losing and winning. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. This being so, in a game where there were an infinity of chances and only one in your favor, you would still be right to wager one life in order to gain two; and you would be making the wrong choice, given that you were obliged to play, if you refused to bet one life against three in a game where there were an infinity of chances and only one in your favor, if the prize were an infinity of infinitely happy life. But the prize here <em>is</em> an infinity of infinitely happy life, one chance of winning against a finite number of chances of losing, and what you are staking is finite."</blockquote>
