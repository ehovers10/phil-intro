<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Arguments as reasons</h3>

<div class="ui-body ui-body-a ui-corner-all eh-bigger">
<p>In a communicative exchange, our objective is to provide reasons for the beliefs we hold. In order to do this, we need a way of conveying our reasons.</p>
<p>The most important tool that philosopher's have for conveying reasons is the <strong>argument</strong>.</p>

<p>In this class, weâ€™re going to try to put all our <strong>reasons</strong> that we give for various beliefs into the form of an <strong>argument</strong>.</p>

<p>The purpose of this practice is to make it clear what exactly we are <strong>offering</strong> as our reason, and also to make it easier to <strong>assess</strong> whether our reason is a good one.</p>

<p>Frequently when we start an inquiry, we may not have well worked out arguments.  Instead, we look for what we might call <strong>considerations</strong>.  Considerations are ideas that seem to speak in favor of one conclusion over another.</p>  

<p>Once we get a bunch of considerations on the table, we can begin sorting through them and develop them into arguments to see whether the balance of considerations does support one conclusion over the other and how strongly.</p>

<p>But what exactly is an argument?</p>
