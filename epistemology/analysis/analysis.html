Another tool in the philosopher’s toolkit is the process of conceptual analysis. Philosophers are often interested in
understanding complex and abstract concepts. One way to try to understand a complex concept is to attempt to explain it
in terms of simpler (more fundamental, better understood) concepts.
The method of analysis that is of interest to us is to present necessary and sufficient conditions for the application of the
target concept.
For example, say I wished to analyze the (admittedly uninteresting) concept being a brother. I might ask myself what has
to be the case in order for some entity to be considered a brother. I might then provide the following analysis (where the
variable x ranges over all possible entities):
x is a brother
if f
x is a male
x is a sibling
I submit that this is an adequate analysis of the concept being a brother. Each of the conditions on the right is necessary
in order for the entity to be a brother. And when we take them together, they are jointly sufficient. That is, anything that
meets both conditions will thereby be a brother.

Method of counterexample
Much like we did with deductive arguments, the way to test the adequacy of an analysis is to try to imagine hypothetical
scenarios in which the conditions provided fail to be either necessary or sufficient.
For example, imagine that I gave the following analysis:
x is a brother
if f
x is a male
x shares a room with someone else
This is a bad analysis. To spell out why it is bad, imagine a scenario in which we have a person with the following features:
• The person is a male
• The person’s parents had no other children
• The person lives in a dorm room with a friend
Notice that this hypothetical person meets both of the conditions listed in our analysis, but because of the fact about his
parents, we don’t want to say that he counts as a brother. This counterexample shows that the conditions we provided aren’t
sufficient to make something a brother.
This analysis also fails to provide only necessary conditions. Imagine another scenario in which we have a person with the
following features:
• The person is a male
• The person’s parents also have a daughter
• The person lived alone his entire life
This hypothetical person fails to meet the second condition of our analysis, but despite this, he is still a brother. This
counterexample shows that the second condition is not neccesary; one need not meet the condition in order to be a brother.
