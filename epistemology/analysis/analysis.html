<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Conceptual analysis</h3>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>Another tool in the philosopher’s toolkit is the process of conceptual analysis. Philosophers are often interested in understanding complex and abstract concepts.</p>

<p>One way to try to understand a complex concept is to attempt to explain it
in terms of simpler (more fundamental, better understood) concepts.</p> 

<p>The method of analysis that is of interest to us is to present <strong>necessary</strong> and <strong>sufficient</strong> conditions for the application of the target concept.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Being a brother</h4>
<table data-role="table" data-mode="" >
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align:right;">x is a brother</th>
    <td style="text-align:center;">iff</td>
    <td>x is a male</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>x is a sibling</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<ul>
  <li>Each of the conditions on the right is necessary in order for the entity to be a brother.</li>
  <li>And when we take them together, they are jointly sufficient. That is, anything that
meets both conditions will thereby be a brother.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Method of counterexample</h3>
<div class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>Much like we did with Clifford, the way to test the adequacy of an analysis is to try to imagine hypothetical scenarios in which the conditions provided fail to be either necessary or sufficient.</p>
