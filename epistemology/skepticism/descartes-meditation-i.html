<p>Descartes begins his Meditations by describing the goal of his inquiry. He recognizes that much that he takes for granted in his daily life he does so without firm justification.</p>
<p>This is fine for daily life, but Descartes wants to set out a framework for the practice of science.</p>

<div data-role="tabs" data-theme="d">
  <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" class="eh-tablist-left">
    <li><a href="#goal" data-active="true" data-ajax="false">Goal</a></li>
    <li><a href="#crit" data-ajax="false">Criterion</a></li>
    <li><a href="#meth" data-ajax="false">Method</a></li>
  </ul>

<div id="goal" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> To establish a firm foundation for belief on which to rest all of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>Descartes thinks that if he can establish a set of foundational beliefs, then he can build a complete science on top of that.</p>
</div>

<div id="crit" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p><strong>Criterion:</strong> The only adequate foundational beliefs are those that are indubitable.</p>

<p>In order to reach his goal, he must have a criterion by which to judge the adequacy of a belief to serve as a foundation.</p>
<p>Descartes seems to think that the onus is on the individual who wishes to hold a particular belief. Thus, he doesn’t think that he needs to positively show that a belief is false in order to reject it from the foundation.</p>
<p>Instead, he thinks any belief for which he can raise any doubt must be rejected.</p>
</div>
<div id="meth" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p><strong>Method:</strong> Systematic doubt of the sources of belief.</p>

<p>Descartes points out that it would be practically impossible for him to examine each belief he has individually.</p>
<p>Instead, he groups his beliefs in terms of the principles (<strong>sources</strong>) on which they are based. If those sources can be doubted, so too can any belief based on them.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="doubt" class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>The first meditation is written as a back-and-forth in which he puts forward challenges to the adequacy of certain beliefs, and then attempts to rescue others from the onslaught.</p>

<div id="chal1" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>My senses sometimes deceive me, as when I mistake a pile of clothes in a dark room for a person. If a source has ever deceived me before it can certainly be doubted now.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>But the cases in which my senses deceive (things at great distances or in poor light conditions) seem to be outlier cases. When the conditions are right, my senses do just fine. So why should I doubt them when the conditions are good?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="chal2" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>When I am dreaming, I have as vivid experiences as I do when I’m awake. Yet in my dream state, my beliefs are false. I can imagine that I might be dreaming now, so I can’t trust my sensory experiences.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>But when I awake, I can easily tell that I was dreaming. The waking state and the dream state are recognizably different.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="chal3" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>A dream state can be recognized once it ends, but from the “inside” it seems as real as anything. Once again, I cannot be certain that I am not <em>currently</em> in a dream state, so I can’t trust my senses.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>The images formed in dreams (hands, tigers, houses) get all jumbled up in the dream. So maybe the sciences that govern these things (physics, biology, etc) can be doubted.</p>
<p>But the composite images are composed of basic corporeal qualities (shape, size, color, number). Even in dreams the sciences that govern the basic qualities (arithmetic, geometry) still hold.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="chal4" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>Might I then imagine that God has set out to deceive me in everything I think of? Or, if it is inconceivable that God would do such a thing, might there be a <strong>powerful demon</strong> set out to deceive me in every belief I form?</p>
<p>Perhaps each time I evaluate 2 + 3 = 5 or measure the circumference of a circle, he makes me think I am right, even though it is actually wrong. Such a situation seems possible, so even these basic mathematical beliefs can be brought into doubt.</p>

<div id="concl" class="ui-body ui-body-a">
<p>Descartes feels that using his method of doubt he has eliminated from contention as a foundational belief almost every belief he can come up with.</p>

<p>He also recognizes that it is extremely difficult to convince himself to give up these beliefs. So he sets out to pretend that everything he thinks is the case is mere illusion until he can better control the impulses of his mind to believe such things.</p>

<p>He’s a little worried at this point. Maybe there is nothing he can know with certainty. If so, then his project is dead in the water.</p>
