<h4>Shapes</h4>
<p>If I were to stand directly over some table, I will report that it is a rectangle. But if you stand off to the side of that same table, you will report that it looks slightly trapezoidal.</p>
<p>But, no object can be both rectangluar and trapezoidal. So, what we see isn’t the table itself.</p>

<h4>Hot and cold</h4>
<p>If one of my hands is very cold and the other very hot, when I place each in a bucket of warm water, I will have
two very different sensations.</p>
<p>But no object can be both hot and cold. So, what I feel isn’t the water itself.</p>

<h4>Inference</h4>
<p>These examples suggest that what we perceive is not the physical objects themselves. Instead, the content of our perceptions
seem more accurately to be qualities (colors, shapes, smells).</p>
<p>Then we (almost unconsciously) draw an <strong>inference</strong> that there are objects out in the world that correspond to our sense-data.</p>

<h4>Phenomena</h4>
<p>This is the world of our experience. It is the colors, sounds, shapes, and feelings that <strong>appear</strong> to us when we are awake and attentive.</p>

<h4>Neumena</h4>
<p>This is the world <em>behind</em> the experiences. It is the <strong>reality</strong> of objects independent of our interaction with them.

<h4>The limit of knowledge</h4>
<p><strong>Receptivity</strong>: Human knowledge depends on sensibility, and sensibility is receptive: we can have knowledge of an object only in so far as it affects us.</p>
<p>Objects <strong>in themselves</strong> do not affect us. We are only connected to the <strong>phenomenal world</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>"Properties that belong to things as they are in themselves can never be given to us through the senses... It is not that through sensibility we are acquainted in a merely confused way with the nature of things as they are in themselves; we are not acquainted with that nature in any way at all." (Kant, quoted by Langton, p. 341)</blockquote>
<p>We know that the objects must exist in order to give us our phenomenal experience, but we can't know anything about them because they do not directly influence us.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>How do we know an object in itself?</h4>
<p>By being able to single it out from all other possible objects.</p>
<p>We only have direct access to (knowledge of) <strong>relational</strong> properties of things -- how those things affect us.</p>
<p>But these properties tell us about the thing in itself by helping us distinguish it from all other things.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>A new limit to knowledge</h4>
<p>Relational properties always make reference to some other objects. Thus, all of our knowledge requires us to have knowledge of other objects, which in turn requires knowlege of further objects.</p>
<p>But this can't go on forever. Eventually, we'll come to objects we can't relate to any further objects.  We call these the <strong>fundamental objects</strong>.</p>
<p>We can't break through to the fundamental objects themselves because we can't signify those objects apart from all other <em>possible</em> objects. The fundamental objects cannot be known to us in <em>themselves</em>.</p>
