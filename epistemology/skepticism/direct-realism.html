<h4>Knowledge and proof</h4>
<p>Moore admits that he does not have a <strong>proof</strong> of his premise, but he says this is not what he needs. All that he needs (by condition 2) is that the premise be <strong>known</strong> to be true, and it obviously is.</p>
<p>Thus, Moore is relying on the idea that there are things we can know without proof. Instead, we simply know them directly. We can call this position <strong>direct realism</strong>.</p>
