<p>Might I be systematically fooled by an evil demon?</p>

<h4>Response</h4>
<p>But can’t I at least know that there is something that has put these thoughts in my mind, whether they are true or false?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="chal5" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>I was assuming that an evil demon was deceiving me, but couldn’t I be the author of my own thoughts. If it is possible, then I can doubt that anything put the thoughts in me.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>But for me to be the author of my own thoughts, I would have to exist. Can’t I know that?</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="chal6" class="eh-tablist-content">
<p>It seems to me that my existence is bound up with the existence of my body and my senses. But since I have doubted the existence of my body, don’t I also doubt my own existence.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Response</h4>
<p>No! For to doubt is to do something (namely, to think ), and to do something is to exist.</p>
<p>Even if I am being deceived I still must be thinking. And if I am thinking, then then I must be something. I cannot doubt that when I think, I exist.</p>

<p>At this point, Descartes announces the one indubitable truth:</p>
  
<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Cogito ergo sum = I think; therefore, I am.</h4>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">What is this "I" that exists?</h4>

<p>Descartes considers what it is he used to think he was. His conception had two main parts:</p>

<ul>  
  <li><strong>A body</strong>: A thing with size and shape that interacts with other things in the world.</li>

  <li><strong>A soul</strong>: A thing that gives life to his body and experiences through the senses. Descartes’ use of “soul” is probably better understood as “mind”. The mind is a very mysterious thing, and something that Descartes does not understand all that well.</li>
</ul>

<p>But he now recognizes that each of the attributes he assigns to his body he can imagine existing without.</p>
<p>The only thing that he sees is inseparable from his existence is his ability to think, and that is a feature of his mind.</p>
<p>So, whatever else he may be, he knows with certainty that he is <strong>a thinking thing</strong>. He is something that doubts, wills, understands, imagines, and experiences.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">The Cartesian Theatre</h4>

<p>Descartes recognizes that when he imagines, there is
something that his imagining is <strong>about</strong>, what we will call the <strong>content</strong> of the imagining.</p>
<p>For instance, if I imagine a dog jumping after a frisbee, then the content of my imagining involves a dog, a frisbee, and the act of jumping.</p>
<p>Sometimes the content of his thoughts doesn’t match up with the way the world actually is -- his thoughts are false.<p>
<p>But even then, he still can’t deny that he <strong>seems to be</strong> imagining what he is.</p>
<p>Descartes has a picture of the mind in which content of our
minds is <strong>transparent</strong> and certain to us. This picture of the mind is known as the Cartesian Theatre.</p>
<p>This realization gives us an additional bit of certainty. In addition to knowing that he exists, Descartes also knows the content of his mind.</p>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">The examination of the wax</h4>

<p>When Descartes uses his sense to examine physical things like a piece of wax, all of its properties (its size, shape, color, smell) seem so clear to him. But when he turns his attention to the mind, he finds it is a complete mystery.</p>

<div data-role="collapsibleset">
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>Essence and necessity</h4>
<p>But wait a second: He notices that when he puts the wax near the
fire, all its properties change. Yet despite this change, the same wax remains.</p>
<p>So the specific properties the wax has don’t make it what it is.</p>
<p>There must be something general that makes the wax what it is.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h4>What is the essence of body?</h4> 
<p>Descartes says that when you strip everything else away, you’re left with:
<h5 class="ui-bar">Extension, Flexibility, and Changeability</h5> 

These are general properties, in that the wax need not have any <em>specific</em> extension, but it must be extended some way.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a ui-corner-all">How do we recognize essence?</h4>

<p>It can’t be by imagining all the possibilities because the wax could take any manner of different shape, and there are too many for us to imagine all of them.</p>

<p>Instead, it is simply something we recognizes through pure mental scrutiny.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-e ui-corner-all">Clear and distinct perception</h4>

<p>Even when we form beliefs using our senses, we always employ a <strong>judgment</strong>, which is a pure mental activity.</p>

<p>This is the basic idea of <strong>Rationalism</strong>. It is the idea that the source of beliefs is the intellect, and not merely sensory experience.</p>

<p>When we just go about our daily lives, our judgments may sometimes be confused, but when we sit down and focus on the issue, we can make our judgments on the matter more clear.</p>

<p>Since the judgment that he exists as a thinking thing is the most clear and certain judgment he has, he recognizes that in actuality he knows his mind much more clearly than he knows his body.</p>

<p>From this, Descartes concludes:</p>

<h4 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">I can know with certainty anything I judge as clearly and distinctly as I judge that I exist.</h4>

<p>Descartes calls this kind of clear judgement the <strong>natural light</strong>. In philosophical circles, we call it <strong>intuition</strong>. Intuitions are things that we know to be true independent of our experience.</p>

<p>Descartes proposes that he can proceed to build up his knowledge as long as he maintains a clear and distinct perception of any beliefs he forms.</p>
