### The Quine/Duhem thesis {: bar}

Popper’s thesis, known as *Falsificationism* has been greatly influential. There’s no doubt that it provides an interesting insight into the nature of scientific inquiry. 

Unfortunately, it can’t be correct as it stands. Notice that Popper’s suggestion relies on the following assumption.

**Single hypothesis testing:** For any hypothesis proposed by a genuine science, a test can be devised for which a possible result would show the hypothesis to be false.

Popper’s idea is that if there is no way for a hypothesis to possibly be shown to be false, then it isn’t genuinely scientific. Unfortunately, this assumption renders all hypotheses unscientific. 

The reason is that we never test hypotheses in isolation.

To see the import of this thesis, consider the following example:

+ Imagine that you and I are arguing about whether the Earth is flat or round. I claim that it is flat, and you that it is round. Thus, we have the following hypotheses in isolation.

(H1) The Earth is flat.

(H2) The Earth is round.

To resolve the debate, we devise an experiment. We will go to the shore and watch a ship sail off over the horizon. If **H1** is correct, then our prediction is that the ship will stay completely in sight and just get smaller as it sails away. But if **H2** is correct, then as the ship sails over the horizon, it will appear to disappear into the water. The hull will go first, and eventually the sails will be the last to go.

We perform the experiment, and we find that the ship disappears into the water with the sails the last to go. You claim victory! But I say, “Not so fast. Our real debate is between the following two theories.”

(T1) The Earth is flat, AND light waves travel in downward curving lines.

(T2) The Earth is round, AND light waves travel in straight lines.

These elaborated theories both predict the results of our experiment. I have saved my hypothesis from falsification by combining it with an *ancillary hypothesis*. 

The Quine/Duhem thesis maintains that for any experiment you devise, there is some
ancillary hypothesis that I can add to my claim such that it makes the right prediction.

The upshot is that we can’t just rely on the results of scientific experiments to decide between conflicting theories. As far as the experimental data is concerned, any single hypothesis is just as good as any other. Thus, we are still in need of an answer of the
demarcation problem.

It is at this point that Kitcher’s explanation of *independent testability*, *unification*, and *fecundity* comes in. His proposal is that while we can’t distinguish independent hypotheses based on the data, we can evaluate whole theories based on these criteria. What makes one theory better than another is that it meets these criteria to a greater extent.
