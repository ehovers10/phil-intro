I may claim to know that a friend of mine is in Oregon on the basis of a postcard I received from him postmarked in Oregon

+ Not a relation of ideas: There’s no contradiction in thinking my firend isn’t in Oregon
+ Not a matter of fact: I don’t have direct experience of my friend being in Oregon

relation between *events*: effect follows cause

+ based on past experience + memory

That **C** *causes* **E** is not a matter of fact: We never directly experience the cause, we only see the events following in succession, and we *infer* a causal relation.
We do experience **constant conjunction**: in the past, events of type **C** have always been followed by events of type **E**

## From constant conjunction to cause 
{: bar}

Causal inferences: *If I release this piece of chalk, it will fall to the ground*

1. In the past, events of chalk releasing have been constantly conjoined with events of chalk falling.
2. The future will be like the past.
3. So, if I release this piece of chalk, it will fall to the ground.

Uniformity of nature: *The idea that the future will resemble the past*

+ Not a relation of ideas: There’s no contradiction in believing that there might be some miraculous event in which the future diverges from the past
+ Not a matter of fact: We never directly experience the future


1. In the past, future events have resembled past events.
2. The future will continue to be like the past.
3. So, the future will be like the past.

This fails Moore's 2nd condition on a rigorous proof: Premise 2 is identical to the conclusion.
