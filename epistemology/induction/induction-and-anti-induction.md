**Induction:** An argument that proceeds from a premise about observed facts to a conclusion about unobserved facts.

 1. The last 10 9 days, the sun has risen. | 1'. The last 10 9 days, the sun has risen.
 2. The pattern of laws is uniform.        | 2'. Every 10 9 days, the laws flip.
 3. So, the sun will rise tomorrow.        | 3'. So, the sun will not rise tomorrow.

### What does it mean to trust our senses? {: bar}

The two arguments above have exactly parallel structure. Each makes a prediction based on a store of evidence from our senses. But they come to the opposite conclusion. 

If we are genuinely to avoid paralysis in relying on our senses, we better come up with some way of deciding between these two arguments. 

Clearly, the *Inductive Argument* is the one we use in practice. But what can the empiricist appeal to to justify the truth of (2) over (2’)?

+ It doesn’t seem that either (2) or (2’) is contradictory, so we can’t appeal to their differing logical status.
+ We may be inclined to suggest that (2) is better supported because we’ve never experienced the weird non-uniformity that (2’) appeals to. 

But notice that this is just to say that the world has always been uniform in the past, so it will probably be uniform in the future! Thus, this suggestion appeals to the very principle we are trying to justify.

###Hume’s skeptical solution

**Habit:** Our psychological makeup is such that we are impulsively inclined to expect the future to resemble the past

**Justification vs. explanation:** This proposal explains why we tend to follow the inductive argument rather than the anti-inductive one, but it doesn’t show that the inductive argument is better justified, or more rational.
