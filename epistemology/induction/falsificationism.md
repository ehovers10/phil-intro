<div id="demarcation-problem" class="ui-body ui-body-a" markdown="1">

Hume consigns inductive reasoning to the wastebasket of psychological habit. But the problem is that all inductive reasoning is equally impacted. 

Thus, for example, astronomy and astrology are on equal footing as regards the predictions they make. But surely some scientific theories are better than others, right? 

Coming up with a viable way of making this distinction is the **demarcation problem.**

<div id="science-as-induction" class="ui-body ui-body-a" markdown="1">

Observe −→ Theorize −→ Predict

If this is our view of science, then the whole enterprise runs headlong into the problem of induction

<div id="falsification" class="ui-body ui-body-a" markdown="1">

Karl Popper has suggested that the problem of induction cannot be solved. Instead, the trick is to rethink the way science works. He presents the following alternative model.

Hypothesize −→ Test −→ Falsify

**Example:** Imagine that we go out one Friday and see 5 different swans, each of which is white. We then formulate the following hypotheses regarding swan color:

(H1) All swans are white

(H2) Every 6th swan is red, the rest are white

(H3) Swans viewed on Fridays are white, and swans viewed on other days are green

We then devise and perform tests that distinguish these hypotheses.

+ Never achieve proof: no matter how many tests we do, there will always be many hypotheses compatible with the data
+ But we can make progress: as we rule certain hypotheses out, our understanding of swans increases.

This approach allows us to distinguish between genuine and pseudo-science

+ If no possible test result could falsify the theory, then it is not a genuine science
