**Rationalism:** All ideas have as their ultimate source an action of the pure intellect--a judgment

+ Thus, at least some of our ideas may be independent of experience.

**Empiricism:** All ideas have their ultimate source in some experience

+ *Motivation:* Evidently, people who lack certain sensory faculties (blind or deaf people, for instance) also lack the ideas associated with those senses. This fact suggests that the ideas really have experience as their source.
+ *Consequence regarding complex ideas:* Empiricism entails that every complex idea can be analyzed into a bunch of simpler ideas of which one has had direct experience.

**Relations of ideas:** Ideas whose denial involves a contradiction

+ examples: 
    + “2 + 2 = 4”
    + “No object is both blue and red (all over at the same time”
+ a priori: 
    + These ideas can be seen to be true independently of experience.
+ no claim on the external world: 
    + Since they only *relate* other ideas, these ideas don’t tell us whether there is anything in the world outside our minds that corresponds to them.

**Matters of fact:** Ideas whose denial involves no contradiction

+ examples: 
    + “There is a table in front of me”
    +  “There is a white swan on the lake”
+ a posteriori: 
    + Since we can’t know these ideas with certainty, we require experience to verify them.
+ involve a claim about the external world: 
    + These ideas are directly about things out in the world.
