# Midterm exam 1 review guide

The first midterm exam will take place during class on **October 6**. The exam will cover everything that we have discussed in class so far. That is, it will cover Philosophical method and Epistemology up through the Analysis of Knowledge.

The exam will involve **5 short answer questions** (there will be 7 options from which you choose 5) and **3 extended response questions** (there will be 5 options from which you choose 3).

You are allowed to prepare one piece of paper of notes that you can bring into the exam with you.  You can write anything you want anywhere you want on this one piece of paper.

To direct your study efforts, I have prepared a list of questions addressing the major ideas we covered in class. If you can answer these questions, you will do well on the exam.

## Philosophical method

### Reasons

+ What is the objective/subjective distinction? explanatory/justificatory? epistemic/pragmatic? pro tanto/on balance? foundationalism/coherentism?
+ What qualities does a *genuine choice* have, according to William James, and what do each of these qualities mean?
+ Why does James think it is ok to choose to believe despite the evidence when one's choice is genuine?

### Argument

+ What is a philosophical argument?
+ What is the difference between a *deductive* argument and an *inductive* argument?
+ What does it mean for a deductive argument to be *valid*? *sound*? for an inductive argument to be *strong*? *cogent*?
+ What is *decision theory* and what role do *decision matrices* and *expected utility* play in it?
+ What is Pascal\'s argument that you ought to believe in God?
+ Who is *Anti-god* and why is the possibility of his existence problematic for Pascal\'s argument?

### Belief

+ What is the *functional account* of belief?
+ What does W.K. Clifford think about believing without sufficient evidence?
+ What is Clifford\'s *ship-owner* thought experiment? What is our *intuition* in this case? What conclusion does Clifford draw from it?
+ What is a *thought experiment*?
+ What does it mean to say that beliefs have *social impact*?

## Epistemology

### Skepticism

+ What is Descartes\' goal in the Meditations?
+ Who is Descartes\' *evil demon* and what is the challenge he poses?
+ What does \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" mean? Why is this idea significant?
+ What does it mean to say, as Descartes does, that our thoughts are *transparent* to us?
+ What is a *clear and distinct idea* for Descartes?
+ What is a *thing-in-itself*?
+ What are *perspectival differences* in experiences (remember the spinning dancer)? Why are they significant?
+ What is the *phenomenal world*? the *neumenal world*?
+ What does it mean to say that human knowledge is *receptive*?
+ What is G.E. Moore's argument for the existence of the external world?

### Analysis of knowledge

+ What is *conceptual analysis*? How do *necessary* and *sufficient* conditions play into it?
+ What is the *JTB* analysis of knowledge?
+ Describe one of Edmund Gettier's thought experiments. Why is this problematic for the JTB analysis of knowledge?
+ What is the *Meno problem*?
