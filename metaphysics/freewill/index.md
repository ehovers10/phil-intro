# Free will and determinism

It may seem perfectly obvious that humans have free will. When we sit and reflect on our actions in the world it is almost impossible to deny the feeling that our choices make a difference in the world. But it turns out that free will is not so simple as it seems. And on deeper investigation it might turn out that if we possess free will at all, what it amounts to might be much different than our initial idea of it.

To help our investigation of free will, we will make use of models. Models are tools used to represent particular features of a curious phenomenon using notions on which we have a better handle. The model abstracts away from certain features and focuses on others. We
will use models to characterize particular features of the world relating to our notions of causation and free will. In the models, circles represent events, arrows represent causation, and the direction of the arrows represents the flow of time.

Free will As a first pass, we might think that possessing free will requires that there be multiple options (choices, possible actions) open to an agent at any point of decision. If there is only one possible action an agent can make then she lacks free will in that decision.

Thus, we might think of the world as a garden of forking paths, as in the model below:

## Determinism 

Unfortunately, the model above conflicts with the thesis of determinism, which states that at any time, the way things are in conjunction with the laws of nature, determines a unique future (continuation of the path of time). Thus, we might model a deterministic world as below:

<img src="{{ 'determinism.png' | prepend: '/images/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Determinism" title="Determinism">

Now, free will is immensely well motivated by our experience of the world, but determinism is also quite well motivated. Whenever we make a prediction about what will happen next, we rely on the belief that the world follows a particular causal order. But it seems that free will and determinism are incompatible; free will requires multiple options, and determinism says there is always only one. So one of them has to go.

## Interterminism 
An initial thought is just to deny indeterminism. It’s almost self-evident that we possess free will, and determinism might not seem to be all that important of a thesis to hold on to. So, we might take the following model of the world, where wavy lines
represent a non-causal connection between the events.

<img src="{{ 'indeterminism.png' | prepend: '/images/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Indeterminism" title="Indeterminism">

But this model is insufficient. We know that just one of the events is going to take place, but this model doesn’t tell us why a particular event happens. We could fill out the model by saying that the wavy lines represent a random process. But if our goal is to save free will then this model won’t do. Having multiple options is one facet of free will, but we also think that having control over what option comes about is crucial to our action being free. If the process that brings events about is random, then it isn’t a matter of our will.

## Agent causation 

Perhaps we could fill out the indeterministic picture in a different way. It might be intuitively plausible to suggest that the world leaves certain things underdetermined, and when there are those indeterminacies, it is up to that agent to make the decision
and bring about the action. Thus, we get a model something like the following:

<img src="{{ 'agent-cause.png' | prepend: '/images/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Agent Cause" title="Agent Cause">

We don’t want to say that the "Agent" circle in our model is just another event, because then we would need to ask what brought that event about, and we’d be right back where we started. Instead, the idea is that the way in which an event is brought about by an agent's decision is different in kind from ordinary event causation. The idea would be that there are two kinds of causation:

+ Event causation: The striking of the lightening caused the forest fire.
+ Agent causation: John caused the car crash.

Agent causation might not be incoherent, but it’s a pretty mysterious thing. There are a number of questions we’d like to have answered:

+ What exactly is the mechanism by which agent causation takes place?
+ Most of the world seems to run deterministically by event causation. Why do we see indeterminacies only when matters of freewill are in play?

## Compatibilism 

We seem to be at an impasse. It’s difficult to give up the idea that we possess free will, but it’s also difficult to get around determinism. But maybe there’s a way to understand free will such that it’s compatible with determinism.

The basic requirement of free will was that multiple options be open for the agent. We modeled that idea with the “garden of forking paths”. But compatibilists suggest that there is a different way to model this notion. They point to the following distinction:

+ Physically possible path: A course of events that violates no laws of nature.
+ Physically possible continuation: A future course of events that, given the current state of things, violates no laws of nature.

According to determinism, there is only ever one possible continuation from the current state of the world. But that doesn’t mean that alternate possible paths aren’t possible. The compatibilist suggests that we model the world in the following way:
  
<img src="{{ 'compatibilism.png' | prepend: '/images/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Compatibilism" title="Compatibilism">

In this model, the distinct paths represent alternate possible ways the world could have been. We happen to find ourselves on one of these, but the others are still possible. The compatibilist maintains that the fact that these other worlds could have obtained is what makes it the case that the events that take place there are open for us.

**Do these possibilities genuinely count as open for us?** There’s no sense in which we decide which of these worlds comes about. That is, we don’t have a choice in the matter. The compatibilist must deny that choice in this sense is essential to free will. But the compatibilist doesn’t have to deny that our desires are causally efficacious. They can accept that when we act freely it is our desires that brings about our actions. In this sense, the actions are in our control. But given the desires we had and the laws of nature, the action that
results was uniquely determined.

It might still seem that the compatibilist is missing something crucial about free will. So, we might try to say a bit more clearly what we take to be important to free will. One thing that seems to be important is responsibility. We tend to ascribe praise and blame for actions that people perform only when we think they did so of their own free will. And it might seem that if we don’t have a choice over which
world obtains, then we can’t be held responsible for whatever actions result.

**The principle of alternate possibilities** Harry Frankfurt examines the notion of responsibility and suggests that there needn’t really be any tension between determinism and responsibility. He points out that claims to the opposite seem to rely on what he calls the principle of alternate possibilities.

> _A person is morally responsible for what he/she has done only if he/she could have done otherwise._

In most cases, this principle seems to hold up. For instance, we generally don’t hold people responsible for their actions in cases such as:

+ Coercion: Such as when a person is forced to perform an action at gunpoint.2
+ Hypnosis: Where a person acts without any inner reason for doing so.
+ Inner compulsion: Such as an addict, who acts because he can’t stop.3

In these cases, the individuals involved face a set of circumstances that **both bring it about that they act and make it impossible that they do otherwise**. That is, these circumstances serve as the cause both of the action and of the impossibility of doing otherwise.

But not all cases are this way. Sometimes we can separate the circumstances that bring the action about from those that made it impossible to do otherwise. Consider a case in which the following events take place:

1. Jones decides to perform action A.
2. A threat is imposed on Jones to do A or else.
3. Jones does A.

**Is Jones responsible?** It’s not clear that we have enough information to answer the question. Consider three different extensions of the case:

+ Jones<sub>1</sub> : always does what he decides. The threat doesn’t matter because his mind was already made up.
+ Jones<sub>2</sub> : is stampeded by the threat. Once he receives the threat his past decision is umimportant.
+ Jones<sub>3</sub> : takes both his decision and the threat intoconsideration. Both are good reasons, but he bases his action on his decision.

Intuitively, Jones1 and Jones3 are responsible for their actions, while Jones2 should not be held accountable. But notice that in every case, the presence of the threat ensures that Jones couldn’t have done otherwise. Thus, whether one could have done otherwise is not enough to establish their responsibility.

Frankfurt suggests that what drives our ascriptions of responsibility is not the presence of alternatives, but the reason that brings about the person’s action. For both Jones<sub>1</sub> and Jones<sub>3</sub> , the reason they acted was their decision to do so. They stand behind their action by acting on this reason, and this is what makes them responsible. Jones<sub>2</sub> gets off the hook because he doesn’t stand behind the action the way the others do.

Frankfurt suggests we can revise the earlier principle to better make sense of these cases:

> _A person is not morally responsible for an action if he/she did it only because he/she could not have done otherwise._

The ides behind this revised form is that we have to look to the person’s reason for acting. If the reason is a desire (or a decision), then they are responsible, but if the reason is just because there was no other choice (like the desperate person facing a threat), then their responsibility is mitigated.

Application to compatibilism The compatibilist can make use of Frankfurt’s discussion to explain why being responsible is compatible with determinism. Since some of our actions are caused by our desires, we can be held accountable for those. We don’t need the presence of alternative choices in order to make sense of why people are sometimes responsible.

There’s no clear cut winner in the debate between incompatibilists and compatibilists. Certainly, compatibilism might still strike us as missing something. But given the difficulties of reconciling free will with determinism, thinking through the implications of compatibil ism might just give us a better understanding of what it is to act freely and make decisions in the world.
