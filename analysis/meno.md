### Socrates’ trouble with knowledge

Knowledge, it seems, differs from mere true judgment. For, one can truly judge some matter accidentally, as it were. 

Perhaps what distinguishes the knower is his ability to give an account of what she judges.

But what is an account?

+ Making one’s thought apparent by speech?
  - Too weak: one could do so by simply stating the proposition.
  - Too strong: knowing doesn’t require the ability to speak.
+ Giving an answer by reference to the elements of the thing known?
  - Too weak: one could do so accidentally, as when the beginning speller gets “Theatetus” right.
  - Too strong: one can know something without understanding every detail, as one can know what a wagon is without knowing all 100 of its parts.
+ Differentiating the thing known from all other things?
  - Too weak: one must differentiate a thing in order to hold it in thought, so mere true judgment also requires differentiation.
  - Unhelpful: if to know is to come to know the means of differentiation, then we have gotten no further.
