Case 2: Fake barns
Henry is driving in the countryside, looking at objects in fields. He sees what looks exactly like a
barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. Now, that is indeed what he is doing. But what
he does not realize is that the neighborhood contains many fake barns–mere barn facades that look like
real barns when viewed from the road. And if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been
deceived into believing that he was seeing a barn.
