Justification as primitive 

Perhaps we can’t provide an adequate analysis of what it is to have an account, but
we all have a fairly good sense of when one’s belief is justified. Perhaps we can illuminate the concept of knowledge without an analysis of justification.

S knows that p
iff
S believes that p
p is true
S’s belief that p is justified

Case 1: Jones and the Ford
Smith has good evidence that Jones, who is Smith’s coworker, owns a Ford. He has seen Jones driving around in one, Jones has brazenly flaunted registration papers for a Ford in front of Smith, and so on. On the basis of this evidence, Smith infers that someone in his office owns a Ford. As it so happens, Jones has recently sold his Ford. But it also happens that Thomas, another of Smith’s coworkers, owns a Ford; although, Smith has never seen him drive it.
